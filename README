As of Swift 4.0, Xcode 9.2, running Release build on iPhone 6S, iOS 11.2.6, Swift Compiler setting is -O -whole-module-optimization:

class version took 2.06 seconds
struct version took 4.17e-08 seconds (50,000,000 times faster)
(I no longer average multiple runs, as variances are very small, under 5%)
